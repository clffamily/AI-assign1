        Nodes generated      Nodes expanded     Solution cost
Test 1  1181  		     489   		39
Test 2	517		     194		21
Test 3	1030		     366		24
Test 4	1179		     376		fails to find a solution
Test 5	6885		     2031		fails to find a solution
Test 6	41		     21			4
Test 7	56		     41			23
Test 8	540		     200		28
Test 9	2756		     976		140

Note that some of these tests, such as 4, 5, and 6, emphasize correctness over testing efficiency
Tests 8 and 9 are designed so that the Manhattan distance heuristic does not work particularly well

Fuelmaze test results (Manhattan distance heuristic):

Taskscheduling test results (uniform cost heuristic):

        Nodes generated      Nodes expanded     Solution cost
Test 1  965   		     570   		60
Test 2	5121		     1883		68
Test 3	18895		     9120		30
Test 4  102869		     5243		11

All of these tests are somewhat small, making nodes explored better for determining efficiency than time.
For fuelmaze you can use the mazegen function to make larger tests by using a larger parameter value.
For taskscheduling different implementations can lead to different node counts, different values do not necessarily mean your answer is incorrect.
Solution costs should match exactly when using an admissible heuristic.
